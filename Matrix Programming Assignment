Matrix Programming Assignment

Write a Console program to play Mastermind
The application creates a secret code of 4 digits. Each digit must be between 1 and 6. The code breaker 
(user) gets some number of chances to figure out the code (configurable). The code breaker will enter 
their guess at the command line when prompted (ex: 1234). The application will then respond with 
some number of +’s and -’s where the +’s are always printed before the -’s. If the code breaker guesses 
correctly, the program prints “You solved it!”. If the code breaker runs out of tries, the program prints 
“You lose :(“

The scoring rules are:
For each number in the guess that matches the number and position of a number
in the secret code, the score includes one plus sign. For each number in the guess
that matches the number but not the position of a number in the secret code, 
the score includes one minus sign.

Each position in the secret code can only be matched once. For example, a
guess of 1134 against a secret code of 1234 would get three plus signs: one
for each of the exact matches in the first, third and fourth positions. The
number match in the second position would be ignored.

Programming Language
C# is preferred. If you listed C# on your resume, C# is expected. If you do not know C#, we will also 
accept Java. 

Tools
You can use Visual Studio Express or other IDEs or your favorite text editor. Feel free to do as much 
research as you’d like. But refrain from copying and pasting code from the internet!

Style
We want to see what you think good maintainable code looks like. As such use whatever code style, 
design approach, and architecture you prefer for solving this problem.

interview with you to discuss your solution.
